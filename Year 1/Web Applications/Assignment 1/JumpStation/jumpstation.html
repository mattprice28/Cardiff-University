		<h2>About JumpStation</h2>
		<h3>What is JumpStation?</h3>
		<p>JumpStation was the world's first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">web crawler</a>. Very simply a web crawler takes key words and 'crawls' through existing web pages looking for matches, returning a series of hyperlinks as results.</p> 

		<p>While today this concept is fundamental to even the most basic of web users, before the introduction of JumpStation the web was a very difficult place to navigate.</p>

		<h3>Life Before JumpStation</h3>
		<p>So how did early web users find their way around? One way to navigate to different web pages was to type the URL, sound simple? Well think again, this was before your web browser could correct errors and give suggestions, a single spelling mistake or typo would lead to ... well nothing.</p>

		<h3>An Early Browser</h3>

		<p>The first site recognisable as a modern day browser was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic</a>. 'Mosaic is an Internet-based global hypermedia browser that allows you to discover, retrieve, and display documents and data from all over the Internet.' (NCSA 1993) As pictured above Mosaic contained a 'What's New' page, this was a chronological list of hyperlinks to available websites </p>

		<h3>The Problem with Mosaic</h3>
		<p>While Mosiac offered a more elegant solution than the painstaking manual entry of URL's it too had it's limitations. The biggest flaw of Mosaic was that it had to be maintained manually, Anyone creating a new website would have to write to the team in charge at the University of Illinois for their URL to be added to the what's new page. If mistakes were made, or if websites were updated, this URL is no longer valid and becomes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">dead link</a></p>

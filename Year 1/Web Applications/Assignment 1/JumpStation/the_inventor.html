		<h2>The Inventor</h2>
		<h3>Jonathon Fletcher</h3>
		<p>Jonathon Fletcher has been dubbed 'the forgotten father of the search engine.' He is the mind behind the creation of JumpStation. By modern standards his program was a very simple one but at the time it was revolutionary.</p>
		<p>Fletcher, originally from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, attended the University of Stirling, Scotland where he studied Computing Science, graduating in 1992 with a first class honours degree.</p>
		<h3>Creation of JumpStation</h3>
		<p>After his graduation Fletcher took a position at the University as a systems administrator, it was during this time that he came up with the idea and created his program. JumpStation launched on the 12th of December 1993 and was added to mosaics what's new page 9 days later.</p>
		<p>His program proved very popular in it's early days, attracting thousands of users, however this popularity would be JumpStations undoing.</p>
		<h3>JumpStations Decline</h3>
		<p>Ultimately JumpStation was short lived, the technological, financial and even physical restraints of the time led to its demise. However promising and widespread JumpStation had become in a short space of time, Fletcher failed to gain the funding he needed to keep his search engine running and it soon began to interfere with his other duties at the University.</p>
		<p>Fletcher was offered a job in Tokyo and decided to take it. He left the UK and JumpStation behind, not even knowing himself that he had laid the foundation for the internet as we know it.</p>
